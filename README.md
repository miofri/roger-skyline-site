Just a very simple website with simple CSS and simple JS I made in an hour.

The project teaches the basics of system and network administration by running a Debian VM & achieving various things such as setting up brdiged or host-only adapter on the VM, connecting to the VM via ssh from host, learning about UFW & cron, writing simple scripts, etc.
